# easy-c
## MPL / Easy Compiler
Also known as easy-c, was written in MPL programming language.

#### [MPL Standard Library](https://github.com:Matway/easy-sl)

Library which contains generic algorithms and data structures for MPL, also provided useful utilities at various stages of the MPL Compiler development, built in MPL.
#### [LLVM IR Library](https://github.com:Matway/easy-llvm) 
Uniform API for creating LLVM IR code, built in MPL.

#### MPL Compiler Features :

* Written in MPL / Easy language,
* Supports dynamic nature of MPL / Easy language,
* Build on core MPL / Easy written Standard Library and LLVM,
* Multi-pass architecture for MPL / Easy optimization,
* Capable of compiling any MPL code with any complexity
* Ability to built transformable LLVM IR codes,
* Builds binary executable files,
* Self-hosted,
* Powered by Clang,
* Open source project.

### Building MPL Compiler

* **1.** git clone git@[github.com:Matway/easy-c](https://github.com:Matway/easy-c).git,
* **2.** cd easy-c,
* **3.** git clone git@[github.com:Matway/easy-sl](https://github.com:Matway/easy-sl).git sl,
* **4.** git clone git@[github.com:Matway/easy-llvm](https://github.com:Matway/easy-llvm).git llvm,
* **5.** Extract all files from bundle : [https://matway.net/easy/easyc_bundle.7z](https://matway.net/easy/easyc_bundle.7z),
* **6.** Run build.bat.

Resulting ***test.exe*** is the easy compiler binary. It can be renamed to ***easyc.exe***.
